This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to get to know a little better about this library and about Server Side Rendering as well! For this project I will also use TypeScript and Styled Components.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
